Abstract
People around the world are passionate about their food culture and they tend to think their food is most unique. Food and nutrition data provide an invaluable information about the culinary culture around the world and shows strong similarity between the taste preferences. Using a database of over 9000 recipes and more than 20 cuisines we analyze ingredients and their nutritional values and use this knowledge to assess the predictability of recipes from different cuisines. We also determine how the food of different countries far separated geographically are similar. By performing different analyses on the food data set of different countries, this project studies and shows similarities between the different food cultures by studying the top ingredients, and the common ingredients used in different cuisines and their nutritional values.
